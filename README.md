In 2016, Postal Slime was released on the Google Play Store for Android and the App Store for iOS. Although it is no longer available for either platform, it is now free to download for Windows.

Note: the Windows version is a development build that was made for testing. The mouse controls may be a bit quirky, as this was never intended to be played on desktop. To my knowledge, this build is 100% identical to the version that was released for mobile platforms.
